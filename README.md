Make sure you have the requirements shown at the output, including XCode, Cocapods for iOS and macOS devices.

Navigate to project directory and run 
```
flutter clean

Open the project in Android Studio or VSCode and make sure you have Flutter pre-requisites needed for running the app, including the Dart and Flutter extension and manually run the files. For iOS devices, open the project in XCode and navigate to iOS files and open up Runner.xcproj and set up team and signing on XCode and run the program.
